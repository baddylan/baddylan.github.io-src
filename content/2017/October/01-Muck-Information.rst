I figured it's time to provide the actual information for the MUCK. The hostname to connect with is fadedstars.xyz port 7072.

The command used to add it to TinyFugue is

::

        /addworld <MUCK Name> [<character> <password>] fadedstars.xyz 7072

Then you connect with

::

        /world <MUCK Name>

And there you go!

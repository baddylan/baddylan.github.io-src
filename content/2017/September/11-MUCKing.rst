How to get started with MUCKS
-----------------------------

Once you've connected to the MUCK, you'll want to connect as a guest user if you don't already have a character. Then go ahead and page a wizard to get a character. You can that with the following command:

::

	p <wizard>=Hey, I'm looking to get a character, can you help me?

To find a list of wizards, use the command 'wizzes'. A wizard may not respond right away, so please don't spam them.

Now that you've gotten a character, disconnect from the MUCK as a Guest, and you should have an email containing your username and password. To use these, type

::

	connect <character> <password>

Now that you've connected, let's go ahead and change your password. Type "@password <oldpassword>=<newpassword>". You've now changed your password to one you'll remember! Now, from here go ahead and ask for help from others, for setting your player information, and acquiring a home.
